Half past twelve and I'm watchin'
The late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evenin' on my own

Autumn winds blowing outside the window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed
To see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness till the break of the day

Movie stars find the end of the rainbow
With the fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm livin' in

Tired of TV, I open the window
And I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see
No one in sight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness till the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness till the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness till the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness till the break of the day
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?

Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme
