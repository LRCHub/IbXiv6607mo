Half past twelve, and I'm watching the late show
In my flat all alone.
How I hate to spend the evening on my own.
Autumn winds blowing outside the window,
As I look around the room,
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom.
There's not a soul out there;
No one to hear my prayer...

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away?
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight!
Take me through the darkness till the break of the day.

Movie stars, find the end of the rainbow,
With that fortune to win.
It's so different from the world I'm living in.
Tired of T.V., I open the window,
And I gaze into the night,
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight.
There's not a soul out there, no one to hear my prayer.

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Take me through the darkness till the break of the day.

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!

There's not a soul out there, no one to hear my prayer.

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Take me through the darkness till the break of the day.
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Take me through the darkness till the break of the day.

Who Needs Love Like That

Who needs love like that

There's something going on
Something not quite right
There's something strange
Happening to me
There's someone at the door
Hear voices in my head
It seems things aren't the way
They ought to be

Who needs love like that
Who needs love like that

It seemed so clear before
I held my point of view
I kept my conversation
Never changed
Now it's all gone wrong
Words are kind of hard
Nothing else around me
Looks the same

Who needs love like that
Who needs love like that
Love can turn you upside-down
And leave you cold
It's plain to see
You're losing all control
(Losing all control)

I'd like to understand
Like to find out why
I can't remember all
The lines that you said
But then I see your face
And nothing really counts
Don't tell me now
This feeling will stay

Who needs love like that
Who needs love like that
Love can turn you upside-down
And leave you cold
It's plain to see
You're losing all control
(Losing all control)

Who needs love like that
Who needs love like that
Love can turn you upside-down
And leave you cold
It's plain to see
You're losing all control
(Losing all control)

Oh l'amour

Oh l'amour
Broke my heart
Now I'm aching for you
Mon amour
What's a boy in love
Supposed to do

Looking for you
You were looking for me
Always reaching for you
You were too blind to see
Oh love of my heart
Why leave me alone
I'm falling apart
No good on my own

Oh l'amour
Broke my heart
Now I'm aching for you
Mon amour
What's a boy in love
Supposed to do

Why throw it away
Why walk out on me
I just live for the day
For the way it should be
There once was a time
Had you here by my side
You said I wasn't your kind
Only here for the ride

Oh l'amour
Broke my heart
Now I'm aching for you
Mon amour
What's a boy in love
Supposed to do

No emotional ties
You don't remember my name
I lay down and die
I'm only to blame
Oh love of my heart
It's up to you now
You tore me apart
I heard inside-out

Oh l'amour
Broke my heart
Now I'm aching for you
Mon amour
What's a boy in love
Supposed to do

Oh l'amour
Broke my heart
Now I'm aching for you
Mon amour
What's a boy in love
Supposed to do

My Heart... So Blue

I've got her picture
It's there on the wall
I can't remember why
I keep it at all
The doors are cold and
All the windows seem grey
I write the book
There's so much more I should say

Wave goodbye
See my heart... so blue
Wave goodbye
See my heart... so blue

And now it's over
I write it all down
No one to notice
One less face in the crowd
Our eyes are open
When it suits us to say
Dear God in heaven
Show no mercy to me

Wave (wave) goodbye
See my heart... so blue
Wave (wave) goodbye
Lost for you

I she'd no tears
And there's no reason for shame
A small consolation
Hides a stone with her name
Just a victim
Still the light shines all bright
I've got her picture
Think I'll hold it tonight

Wave goodbye
See my heart... so blue
Wave goodbye
See my heart... so blue

Wave (wave) goodbye
See my heart... so blue
Wave (wave) goodbye
Lost for you
