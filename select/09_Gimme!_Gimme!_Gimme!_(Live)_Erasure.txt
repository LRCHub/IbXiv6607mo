Half past twelve,
And I'm watching the
Late show
In my flat all alone.
How I hate to spend the
Evening on my own.
Autumn winds blowing
Outside the window,
As I look around the room,
And it makes me so
Depressed to see the gloom.
There's not a soul out there;
No one to hear my prayer...

Gimme, gimme, gimme a
Man after midnight!
Won't somebody help me
Chase these shadows
Away?
Gimme gimme gimme a man
After midnight!
Take me through the
Darkness till the break
Of the day.

Movie stars, find the
End of the rainbow,
With that fortune to win.
It's so different from the
World I'm living in.
Tired of T.V., I open the window,
And I gaze into the night,
But there's nothing
There to see, no one
In sight.
There's not a soul out
There, no one to hear
My prayer.

Gimme, gimme, gimme a
Man after midnight!
Won't somebody help me
Chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a
Man after midnight!
Take me through the
Darkness till the break
Of the day.

Gimme, gimme, gimme a
Man after midnight!
Gimme, gimme, gimme a
Man after midnight!

There's not a soul out
There, no one to hear
My prayer.

Gimme, gimme, gimme a
Man after midnight!
Won't somebody help me
Chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a
Man after midnight!
Take me through the
Darkness till the break
Of the day.
Gimme, gimme, gimme a
Man after midnight!
Won't somebody help me
Chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a
Man after midnight!
Take me through the
Darkness till the break
Of the day.
